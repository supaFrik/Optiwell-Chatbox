# docs Directory

Contains non-code project documentation artifacts (presentations, PDFs) supporting demonstrations and planning.

## Files
- `ai-doctor-voicebit-ppt.pdf` – Slide deck: concept & architecture overview.
- `presentation.pdf` – Additional presentation material.

## Recommendations
- Keep binary docs small; version control large media elsewhere if needed.
- Update slides when architecture or workflow changes (UI, API, STT models).

## Not Included
No generated API docs here—see `src/ai_doctor/README.md` and `REFERENCE.md` for code-level details.
